#
# actions.yaml defines flavour text for each one. If the action is not in this
# file, it won't be supported by the bot. The actions are defined as a list,
# in no particular order, of maps with the following fields:
#
# kind:
#     Both the name of the command as well as the type of gif that will be
#     requested from the api.
# description:
#     The description of the command. required.
# lonely messages:
#     A list of template strings. One of these will be randomly chosen to be
#     sent as a message alongside the gif. Any occurences of the string <user>
#     will be replaced by a mention of the user who sent the command.
#
# Actions can be targetable or nontargetable. A targetable action will take an
# optional "target" argument, a user, who will be mentioned in the bot's
# message. The user is interpreted as the subject of the action, and the target
# as the object of the action. e.g., the user of the "hug" action is the one
# hugging the target.
#
# If an action is targetable but no target was specified, it is usually
# interpreted as nano doing that action to the user.
#
# Targetable actions must have both of these fields set:
#
# targeted messages:
#     A list of message templates to use if the user targets someone other than
#     nano or themself
# nano messages:
#     A list of message templates to use if the user targets nano
#
# In these templates, the string <target> will be replaced by a mention of the 
# target.
# If the user targets themself, the action will pick from "lonely messages".

# Commands that already have messages: 26/68
# airkiss, angrystare, bite, bleh, blush, clap, cuddle, dance, drool, evillaugh, handhold, hug, lick,
# love, nom, nuzzle, pat, poke, pinch, slap, smile, stare, tickle, tired, wave, wink
